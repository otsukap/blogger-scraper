# A scraping utility for Google Blogger

Wrote a small script to scrape all my Google Blogger posts since 2005. The export function for Blogger was useless for my needs. This collects the date, time, title, and body text of the post. Feel free to use if your blog is text based and you don't care about keeping comments, tags, or images.
